This is a simple plugin that allows you to create slugs for text input fields in js.
Given the input:

<input type="text" class="slugme" />
<span class="slug" />

You can say:

$('.slugme').slugger();

As you type in the input field, the slug is then updated in the target element. By default 
the place the slug is placed is any element with the .slug class.  You can pass options to
the slugger call for changing the place the slug is placed.
